        "The simplest way to associate a dense vector to a word would be to pick the vector at random. The problem with this approach is that the resulting embedding space would have no structure: for instance, the words \"accurate\" and \"exact\" may end up with completely different embeddings, even though they are interchangeable in most sentences. It would be very difficult for a deep neural network to make sense of such a noisy, unstructured embedding space.\n",
        "\n",
        "To get a bit more abstract: the geometric relationships between word vectors should reflect the semantic relationships between these words. Word embeddings are meant to map human language into a geometric space. For instance, in a reasonable embedding space, we would expect synonyms to be embedded into similar word vectors, and in general we would expect the geometric distance (e.g. L2 distance) between any two word vectors to relate to the semantic distance of the associated words (words meaning very different things would be embedded to points far away from each other, while related words would be closer). Even beyond mere distance, we may want specific directions in the embedding space to be meaningful.\n",

All sequences in a batch must have the same length, though (since we need to pack them into a single tensor), so sequences that are shorter than others should be padded with zeros, and sequences that are longer should be truncated.\n",

During training, these word vectors will be gradually adjusted via backpropagation, structuring the space into something that the downstream model can exploit. Once fully trained, your embedding space will show a lot of structure -- a kind of structure specialized for the specific problem you were training your model for.\n",

We will restrict the movie reviews to the top 10,000 most common words (like we did the first time we worked with this dataset), and cut the reviews after only 20 words. Our network will simply learn 8-dimensional embeddings for each of the 10,000 words, turn the input integer sequences (2D integer tensor) into embedded sequences (3D float tensor), flatten the tensor to 2D, and train a single Dense layer on top for classification.\n"

        "The rationale behind using pre-trained word embeddings in natural language processing is very much the same as for using pre-trained convnets in image classification: we don't have enough data available to learn truly powerful features on our own, but we expect the features that we need to be fairly generic, i.e. common visual features or semantic features. In this case it makes sense to reuse features learned on a different problem.\n",

        "Such word embeddings are generally computed using word occurrence statistics (observations about what words co-occur in sentences or documents), using a variety of techniques, some involving neural networks, others not. The idea of a dense, low-dimensional embedding space for words, computed in an unsupervised way, was initially explored by Bengio et al. in the early 2000s, but it only started really taking off in research and industry applications after the release of one of the most famous and successful word embedding scheme: the Word2Vec algorithm, developed by Mikolov at Google in 2013. Word2Vec dimensions capture specific semantic properties, e.g. gender.\n",

        "* Another popular one is called \"GloVe\", developed by Stanford researchers in 2014. It stands for \"Global Vectors for Word Representation\", and it is an embedding technique based on factorizing a matrix of word co-occurrence statistics. \n",
        "\n",
        "Let's take a look at how you can get started using GloVe embeddings in a Keras model. The same method will of course be valid for Word2Vec embeddings or any other word embedding database that you can download. We will also use this example to refresh the text tokenization techniques we introduced a few paragraphs ago: we will start from raw text, and work our way up."
